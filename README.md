# Website
This website project is about the famous game Lethal Company, where it presents various contents similar to a traditional website on the internet. With contents such as navigation bars, information, tabled data, and reference links. This project is coded in ***HTML*** together with internal ***CSS***. 

## HTML
The "***section***" element is a structural HTML element used to group together related elements. Each section tag typically includes one or more heading elements and additional elements presenting related content. Grouping tags such as "***video***, ***div***, ***h1***, ***p***, ***blockquote***, ***figcaption***, ***ol***, ***li***, and ***a***." These include different class IDs in order to manipulate text design, position, and transition in internal CSS.

## Internal CSS
Instead of using a separate CSS file, internal CSS can be included in the HTML file using the "***style***" tag. Used to manipulate element tags inside the "***html***" tag by using specific class IDs. Where designs such as "***margin***, ***padding***, ***z-index***, ***display***, ***align-items***, ***background-color***, ***background-filter***, ***transform***, ***font-size***, ***font-decoration***, and ***font-weight***." While syntaxes with "***::hover***" next to a class ID used effectively for "***transition*** where mouse hovers over a certain text or text container." Then, "***::last-child***" where it allows to select the last element in a group of siblings' elements within its defining element.
